# Documentation Images Guide

This file describes the images you should create for the GitHub README to showcase PolypPal.

## Required Images

Place all images in `docs/images/` directory.

### 1. `interface_overview.png` (or use `polyp_pal_logo.png`)
**Purpose**: Main banner image at the top of README
**Content**: 
- PolypPal logo
- OR a wide screenshot of the main interface
**Recommended size**: 1200x400 pixels (banner format)

### 2. `main_interface.png`
**Purpose**: Show the main measurement window
**Content**:
- Full PolypPal window
- Both image panels visible (Timepoint 1 and Timepoint 2)
- Logo at top
- Keyboard shortcuts at bottom
- A few measurements already marked (different colors)
- Plug detection circles visible
**Recommended size**: 1400x900 pixels
**How to capture**: Take screenshot during an active measurement session

### 3. `measurement_demo.png`
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the measurement process
**Content**:
- Close-up of one or two objects being measured
- Visible dots at click points
- Diameter lines clearly visible
- Both perpendicular diameters shown
- Color-coded lines (yellow, cyan, etc.)
**Recommended size**: 800x600 pixels
**How to capture**: Screenshot after measuring 1-2 objects, before marking status

### 4. `annotated_output.png`
**Purpose**: Show the final annotated comparison image
**Content**:
- Side-by-side comparison of Timepoint 1 and Timepoint 2
- Multiple objects measured
- Color-coded measurements with IDs
- Status information visible
**Recommended size**: 1200x600 pixels
**How to capture**: Open one of the saved annotated images from the `annotated_dir` output

## Optional Additional Images

### `rotation_demo.gif` (animated)
**Purpose**: Show rotation in action
**Content**: Short animation of pressing 'q' or 'e' and measurements adjusting
**Recommended**: 500x400 pixels, 2-3 seconds

### `zoom_demo.png`
**Purpose**: Show zoom and pan capability
**Content**: Close-up view of a small object with zoom controls visible

### `excel_output.png`
**Purpose**: Show Excel file structure
**Content**: Screenshot of Excel file with several rows of measurements
**Recommended size**: 1000x600 pixels

## Tips for Great Screenshots

1. **Use real data**: Coral plugs work great, but consider adding an example from another field (bacterial colonies, cell cultures, etc.) to emphasize versatility

2. **Clean interface**: Close any unnecessary programs, clean up desktop if visible

3. **Good lighting**: Make sure images are bright and clear

4. **Annotations**: Consider adding arrows or text to highlight key features

5. **File format**: Use PNG for best quality (not JPG)

6. **Consistency**: Use the same dataset across screenshots for continuity

## Image Credits

If using example images from external sources or collaborators, add attribution in a separate `IMAGE_CREDITS.md` file.

## Placeholder Images

If you don't have all images yet, you can:
1. Remove the image links from README temporarily
2. Use placeholder text like: `[Interface screenshot coming soon]`
3. Add images incrementally as you create them

The README is structured so it still works well without images, though images greatly enhance understanding!
